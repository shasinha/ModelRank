This paper describes a method to rank risk models that comprise a network of models in order to determine the models with the highest risk ranking. This paper draws on the work done by \citet{brin_page} in the PageRank algorithm.

\section{Introduction}

Model Risk has been a principal or key risk in financial institutions since the introduction of the Dodd-Frank act and the associated Fed supervisory letter SR-11-7.\\

Financial institutions have large inventories of models. Models are not just used individually, they are often used collectively, where the outputs of one model are the inputs to other models. Such relationships can be considered networks of models.\\

% Note: in this sample, the section number is hard-coded in. Following

%In this appendix we prove the following theorem from
%Section~\ref{sec:textree-generalization}:

In this appendix we prove the following theorem from
Section~6.2:

\noindent
{\bf Theorem} {\it Let $u,v,w$ be discrete variables such that $v, w$ do
not co-occur with $u$ (i.e., $u\neq0\;\Rightarrow \;v=w=0$ in a given
dataset $\dataset$). Let $N_{v0},N_{w0}$ be the number of data points for
which $v=0, w=0$ respectively, and let $I_{uv},I_{uw}$ be the
respective empirical mutual information values based on the sample
$\dataset$. Then
\[
	N_{v0} \;>\; N_{w0}\;\;\Rightarrow\;\;I_{uv} \;\leq\;I_{uw}
\]
with equality only if $u$ is identically 0.} \hfill\BlackBox

\noindent
{\bf Proof}. We use the notation:
\[
P_v(i) \;=\;\frac{N_v^i}{N},\;\;\;i \neq 0;\;\;\;
P_{v0}\;\equiv\;P_v(0)\; = \;1 - \sum_{i\neq 0}P_v(i).
\]
These values represent the (empirical) probabilities of $v$
taking value $i\neq 0$ and 0 respectively.  Entropies will be denoted
by $H$. We aim to show that $\fracpartial{I_{uv}}{P_{v0}} < 0$....\\
